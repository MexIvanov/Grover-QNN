# Grover-QNN
A quantum circuit for training a very simple neural network built on the principles of Grover's algorithm.

Described in paper "Development and Training of Quantum Neural Networks, Based on the Principles of Grover's Algorithm": https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.01443

The circuit was built in "Quirk" quantum simulator by Craig Gidney https://algassert.com/
